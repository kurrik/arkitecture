Read @specs/architecture.md and then read @specs/prompt-plan.md - determine what needs to be implemented next.

Double check that it hasn't been implemented yet.

Work to implement the next step of the plan. Add tests and run tests regularly.

Fix all test errors you find.

When done with the step, update @specs/prompt-plan.md to mark all the implemented components as complete then stop to let me review the functionality.

I will commit the changes to the repo if they look good.
